Summary:
Decoder error handling modes

Description:
The video decoder can detect some (but not all) decoding errors. These errors can result from a badly encoded stream or bad transmission of a good stream.
For pictures where decoding errors are detected, the decoder can either display them as-is, or it can discard them.
When discarding, it can discard aggressively (i.e. to minimize the chance of the user seeing errors) or conservatively (i.e. to minimize the number of pictures dropped).
These two options have tradeoffs. This enum instructs the decoder what decision to make based on application preferences.

If a picture is discarded, the previous picture will be repeated. The end-user will see a frozen picture until a new picture is available.

Please be aware that there is no guarantee that all decoder errors will be hidden. This is simply best effort.

Summary:
Picture information for the currently displayed picture or the first decoded picture for a new decode.

Description:
NEXUS_VideoDecoderStreamInformation picture information differs from NEXUS_VideoDecoderStatus information in that
NEXUS_VideoDecoderStatus returns information on the currently displayed picture. When starting a new decode,
this could be the last picture from the previous decode.
NEXUS_VideoDecoderStreamInformation always gives picture information from this decode.
When starting decode, after the first picture is decoded, it will be held until its PTS matures.
NEXUS_VideoDecoderStreamInformation will have information about that first picture, before it is displayed.
After the first picture is displayed, NEXUS_VideoDecoderStreamInformation will return the same
picture information as NEXUS_VideoDecoderStatus.

Because this information is available before display, it is similar to the old MPEG sequence header interrupt.
However, after that first picture is displayed, it does not provided any advance warning like a sequence header interrupt.

Any changes in this information will generate a NEXUS_VideoDecoderSettings.streamChanged callback.

/**
Summary:
Video decoder primer settings.

Description:
These settings can be changed before or after NEXUS_VideoDecoderPrimer_Start.

When decode is started with NEXUS_VideoDecoderPrimer_StopPrimerAndStartDecode, Nexus will calculate the difference
between the current STC and the PTS of all random access points (RAP) currently in the buffer. Nexus will then
select a single RAP from which to start decode. This decision affects the momentary behavior immediately after
decode is started, while a STC/PTS discrepancy exists.

pastTolerance and futureTolerance control the above decision in the following manner:

- If there are no RAPs that satisfy either tolerance, then the larger of the two tolerances is taken as a preference.
If pastTolerance > futureTolerance, then Nexus will select the nearest past RAP (STC > PTS).
If pastTolerance < futureTolerance, then Nexus will select the nearest future RAP (STC < PTS)
If pastTolerance == futureTolerance, then Nexus will select the nearest RAP from the current STC.

- If there are one or more RAPs that satisfy one or both tolerances, then Nexus will select the nearest RAP from
the current STC that satisfies a tolerance.
