/*====================== Module Overview ===========================

---++++ *Summary:*

The Kernel Interface is the set of operating system and standard C library functions
required by the Magnum architecture which is portable across all software
and hardware platforms which Broadcom uses.


---++++ *Requirements:*

*Portable* - every function must work on every platform in the same well-defined way.
Some error conditions cannot or should not be standardized, therefore we also include
usage rules (see BKNI_EnterCriticalSection for an example.)
Every platform implementationmust be regularly checked with compliance tests.

*Safe* - Because of the inherent dangers of multitasking,
each kernel interface implementation must ensure there are no race conditions within the
implementation.
The API must also be simple and explicit in order to help developers avoid race
conditions in their code.

*Minimal* - The number of functions should be just enough to allow us to implement the Magnum
architecture. Platform-dependent code should make use of platform-specific functions.


---++++ *Files:*

The kernel interface is divided into three sections:

*bkni.h* is the single-task kernel interface. It is used by code which follows the single-task
model of execution specified in ThreadSafe.

*bkni_multi.h* is the multi-tasking kernel interface. It is used by code which follows
the multi-task model of execution specified in ThreadSafe. bkni_multi.h also includes
bkni.h.

*bkni_metrics.h* is the metrics interface. It must not be called by Magnum code, but
provides system monitoring and debugging to platform-specific code.


<nopublish>
---++++ *Summary of Changes:*

New naming convention.

Replaced structures with opaque handles.

Init and Uninit functions.

Replaced semaphores with mutexes.While a semaphore can be configured as a mutex, it can
easily be misconfigured and introduce race conditions. The combination of a mutex and an event
is simple and sufficient.

Removed sprintf and vsprintf because they introduce possible buffer overruns. snprintf
and vsnprintf are sufficient.

Memory map functionality (MmuMap and UnmmuMap) was moved to the MemoryManager.

Removed debug macros (DBGMSG) and data types (WORD, HANDLE, etc.).
</nopublish>


---++++ *Interrupt Safety:*

The following functions can be called from an ISR or a critical section:

    * BKNI_Memset, BKNI_Memcpy, BKNI_Memcmp, BKNI_Memchr, BKNI_Memmove
    * BKNI_Printf, BKNI_Vprintf
    * BKNI_Delay
    * BKNI_SetEvent
    * BKNI_WaitForEvent, but only with a timeout of zero.

All other functions are not callable from either an ISR or critical section.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
    Print characters to the console.

Description:
    Although printing to the console is very important for development, it cannot
    and should not be guaranteed to actually print in all contexts.
    It is valid for the system developer to eliminate all BKNI_Printf output in
    release builds or if the context demands it (e.g. interrupt context).

    You should use BKNI_Printf instead of
    DebugInterface when you explicity want to print information to a console
    regardless of debug state (e.g. BXPT_PrintStatus, BPSI_PrintPsiInformation).
    BKNI_Printf is also used by the generic DebugInterface implementation.

    We only guarantee a subset of ANSI C format specifiers. These include:

    * %d  - int in decimal form
    * %u  - unsigned int in decimal form
    * %ld - long in decimal form
    * %lu - unsigned long in decimal form
    * %x  - unsigned int in lowercase hex form
    * %lx - unsigned long in lowercase hex form
    * %X  - unsigned int in uppercase hex form
    * %lX - unsigned long in uppercase hex form
    * %c  - an int argument converted to unsigned char
    * %s  - string
    * \n  - newline
    * \t  - tab
    * %%  - % character
    * %03d - Zero padding of integers, where '3' and 'd' are only examples. This can be applied to any of the preceding numeric format specifiers (not %c or %s).
    * Pass-through of non-control characters.

    Beyond these, we do not guarantee the output format.

    For BKNI_Printf and BKNI_Vprintf, other ANSI C format specifiers
    may be used, and platforms should try to make sure that any combination of formats
    and parameters will not cause a system crash.

    When calling BKNI_Snprint and BKNI_Vsnprintf, Magnum code must only use the
    guaranteed format specifiers if the results must always be the same on all platforms.

    BKNI_Printf can be called from an interrupt-context.

Returns:
    >=0 is success. It is the number of characters transmitted.
    <0 is failure, either in encoding or in outputing.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
    Print characters to a null-terminated string.

Description:
    See BKNI_Printf for a description of the format specifiers supported.

    Can be called from an interrupt-context.

Returns:
    If the output is not truncated, it returns the number of characters printed, not
    including the trailing null byte.

    If the output is truncated, it should try to return the number
    of characters that would have been printed had the size of memory been large
    enough. However, this result is not required and no Magnum code should
    depend on this result.

Description:

    parameter. va_list must initialized by the va_start macro (and possibly
    subsequent va_arg calls). The BKNI_Vprintf function does not invoke the va_end macro.

    The value of the va_list parameter may be modified and so it is indeterminate upon return.

    See BKNI_Printf for a description of the format specifiers supported.

    Can be called from an interrupt-context.

    fmt - See BKNI_Printf

Summary:
    Busy sleep.

Description:
    BKNI_Delay is a busy sleep which guarantees you will delay for at least the specified
    number of microseconds. It does not call the scheduler, therefore the Delay is able to be
    less than the system clock time. This consumes CPU time, so it should be used for only
    short sleeps and only when BKNI_Sleep cannot be used.

    Be aware that on a preemptive system, any task can be interrupted and the scheduler can
    run, and so there is no guarantee of maximum delay time. If you have maximum time
    constraints, you should be using an interrupt.

    Can be called from an interrupt-context.

Input:
    microsec - minimum number of microseconds to delay

Returns:
    <none>

Summary:
    Allocate system memory.

Description:
    Allocates space for an object whose size is specified by size and whose
    value is indeterminate.

    System memory is usually managed by an operating system. It differs
    from memory managed by a MemoryManager in that it is not
    guaranteed to be physically continuous and you cannot request alignment.

    Passing a size of 0 is not allowed and leads to undefined behavior.

    The caller is responsible to also call BKNI_Free to free the memory
    when done. Memory that is not explicitly freed
    may or may not remain allocated beyond the life-cycle of a particular
    application.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
    Yield the current task to the scheduler.

Description:
    BKNI_Sleep is a sheduler sleep which guarantees you will delay for at least the
    specified number of milliseconds. It puts the process to sleep and allows the scheduler
    to run. The minimum sleep time is dependent on the system clock time. If you need
    a minimum time which is less that the system clock time, you'll need to use BKNI_Delay.

    Actual sleep time is dependent on the scheduler but will be at least as long as
    the value specified by the millisec parameter.

    A sleep value of 0 should cause the scheduler to execute. This may or may not result in
    any delay.

    BKNI_Sleep cannot be called from an interrupt context. Use BKNI_Delay instead.

Returns:
    BERR_SUCCESS - The system slept for at least the specified number of milliseconds.

    Passing in a name for debugging purposes might lead to someone to think we
    support named events.

    The event is created in an unsignalled state.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
    Wait until an event is signalled by BKNI_SetEvent.

Description:
    Suspends execution of the current task until the event specified by the event parameter
    becomes signalled. The task should be blocked by the scheduler, resulting in no wasted
    CPU time.

    This function fails if the event does not become signalled within
    the period specified by the timeoutMsec parameter. A timeout of zero instructs this
    function to fail immediately if the event is not signalled. A timeout value of
    BKNI_INFINTE (defined in bkni_multi.h) causes this function not to return until successful.

    BKNI_WaitForEvent can be called from a single-task module only if that module follows
    the rules specified under PortingInterface interrupt handling.
    For this reason, BKNI_INFINITE is defined in bkni_multi.h. An event
    that blocks for a less-than-infinite time can be considered as an interruptible
    sleep. See PortingInterface for a description of interrupt handling in a single-threaded
    module.

    A single BKNI_WaitForEvent call will consume all pending signals.

    However, if multiple tasks call BKNI_WaitForEvent for the same event, it is only
    guaranteed that at least one will be woken up with the next BKNI_SetEvent call. Some platforms
    may wake up one, others may wake up all. To avoid problems, Magnum code
    should only wait on a particular event from a single task.

    BKNI_WaitForEvent can be called from an interrupt context, but only if timeoutMsec
    is 0. In this case, it checks if the event has been set, and does not block if it
    has not. Calling BKNI_WaitForEvent from an interrupt context with a non-zero timeout
    leads to undefined behavior.

Returns:
    BERR_SUCCESS - An event happened and was consumed.
    BERR_TIMEOUT - Either the timeout was 0 and no event was already pending, or the timeout expired before an event happened.
    BERR_OS_ERROR - The system interruped the wait and an event did not happen.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
Reset an event so that there are no signals pending.

Description:
In certain cases it is necessary to reset an event in order to avoid a race condition.
Consider the following code:

<verbatim>
    foo() {
        SetHardware();
        err = BKNI_WaitForEvent(event, timeout);
        if (err)
            return err;
        return AcquireData();
    }

    interrupt() {
     BKNI_SetEvent(event);
    }
</verbatim>

And now consider the following execution sequence:

<verbatim>
    foo() called
        setHardware() called
        BKNI_WaitForEvent() called
        BKNI_WaitForEvent times out and foo returns an error.

    Interrupt happens and BKNI_SetEvent called

    foo() called again
        setHardware() called
        BKNI_WaitForEvent() called
        --> BKNI_WaitForEvent returns BERR_SUCCESS from the old interrupt
        AcquireData() is called before it should be.
</verbatim>

In order to avoid this problem, BKNI_ResetEvent must be called before setting or
resetting hardware. Be careful that there is not a race condition between
BKNI_ResetEvent and the actual resetting of hardware. If you cannot disable
the particular interrupt, you need to use a critical section.

<verbatim>
    foo() {
        BKNI_EnterCriticalSection();
        BKNI_ResetEvent(event);
        SetHardware();
        BKNI_LeaveCriticalSection();
        err = BKNI_WaitForEvent(event, timeout);
        if (err)
            return err;
        return AcquireData();
    }
</verbatim>

A simple implementation of BKNI_ResetEvent is to call BKNI_WaitForEvent with a timeout
of 0. For some platforms, there may be a more optimal implementation.

Summary:
    Create a Magnum critical section which protects against concurrent execution by
    another Magnum critical section or Magnum ISR (interrupt service routine).

Description:
    A Magnum critical section is defined as a block of code between a BKNI_EnterCriticalSection
    call and a BKNI_LeaveCriticalSection call or any code inside a Magnum ISR (distinguished with an _isr suffix).
    Be aware that a Magnum critical section may not mean the same thing as an operating system's critical
    section. Typically, operating system critical sections mean that interrupts are disabled and
    no context switch is possible.
    A Magnum critical section may or may not mean this, depending on the implementation of KNI.

    Magnum critical sections cannot be preempted by other Magnum critical sections.
    This includes both interrupts and context switching. But it only applies to Magnum code, not
    to code outside of Magnum. While there are many ways these rules can be implemented in a system, the recommended
    approach is as following:
    * If your system executes Magnum-isr code in interrupt context, Magnum critical sections must be implemented by disabling interrupts.
    * If your system executes Magnum-isr code in task context, Magnum critical sections must be implemented with a global mutex.

    Be aware that on task-context only systems, critical sections may not prevent the scheduler
    from time-slicing and executing non-critical section code concurrently with the
    critical section.

    Critical sections are also used to protect concurrent access to a register shared
    with another module. Ideally, there are no registers shared between disconnected
    software modules, but sometimes this is unavoidable.

    Magnum code cannot nest critical sections. Calling BKNI_EnterCriticalSection from
    inside a critical section is not allowed and leads to undefined behavior.
    Possible results include deadlock or undetected race conditions.

    A platform implementation might chose to allow BKNI_EnterCriticalSection to nest
    because of platform-specific considerations.
