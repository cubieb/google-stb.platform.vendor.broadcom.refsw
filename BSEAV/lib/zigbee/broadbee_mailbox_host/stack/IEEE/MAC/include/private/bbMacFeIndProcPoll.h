  \brief
    Accepts a dispatched Data Request MAC Command frame MPDU surrogate, processes it,
    schedules the pending frame transmission if any persists in the MAC-FE Transactions
    Queue, and issues the MLME-POLL.indication to the ZigBee PRO higher layer if needed.
  \param    mpduSurr
    Pointer to the MPDU surrogate of the received Data Request MAC Command frame.
  \details
    A received MPDU is filtered and deserialized into the structured form called MPDU
    surrogate by the MAC-LE, then it is routed by the MAC-FE Indications Dispatcher to
    this MAC-FE Indication Processor according to the frame type and the command
    identifier. Then this MAC-FE Indication Processor verifies that the received frame is
    addressed to the ZigBee PRO context, that it is properly constructed by its
    originator, and that it is allowed to execute and/or indicate received MAC Commands,
    and then constructs and issues the request to the MAC-FE Transactions Dispatcher and
    finally constructs and issues the MLME-POLL.indication to the ZigBee PRO higher layer.
  \note
    The MLME-POLL.indication is issued even if there is no pending data in the MAC-FE
    Transactions Queue for the received Data Request MAC Command originator.
  \note
    If there is a data pending in the MAC-FE Transactions Queue, the corresponding
    Request/Response (the first of matched ones) is moved from the head of MAC-FE
    Transactions Queue to the head of MAC-FE Main Requests Queue to be processed as soon
    as possible; then MLME-POLL.indication is issued in the same context; and only then
    in the context of MAC-FE Requests Dispatcher task the extracted Request/Response
    processing is started.
